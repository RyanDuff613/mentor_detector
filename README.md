# Mentor Detector

#### Epicodus: Capstone Project

#### Ryan Duff 

## Description
Mentor Detector is a Ruby on Rails app that allows users to sign up, either as a mentor or as someone in search of a mentor. Users can add an association with a technology (programming language, library, framework etc) in which they are interested and see a list of potential mentors/mentees that are working with the same tech, along with their contact info. This project is in progress and is not fully functional. A user can create, read, edit and delete a personal account. Users may also create, read, update and delete a technology but site does not currently have functionality for making relationships between users and technologies or for finding user matches. Eventually Iâ€™d like to add an ability to enable in-app chat between a mentor and a mentee, but that will have to remain a stretch goal for now. Apologies for the complete lack of styling, I prefer to build core functionality with minimum styling first and layer on the fancy stuff once the logic is in good shape.


## Setup/Installation Requirements
Users will need to install Ruby, Rails, psql and Postgres.
[Click here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing Ruby.
[Click here](https://dataschool.com/learn-sql/how-to-start-a-postgresql-server-on-mac-os-x/) for instructions on installing psql and Postgres.
After installing the above software, users will need to clone this project from my [github repository](https://github.com/RyanDuff613/ruby_independent_project4.git). Once cloned, use the command line to navigate to the project folder and install all necessary Ruby Gems with: 
* _$ bundle install_
In the command line, type the following commands which will create the necessary database and launch a local server sso that you can access the application in a browser window.
* _$ rake db:create 
* _$ rake db:migrate
* _$ rake db:test:prepare
* _$ rails s
Now open a web browser and enter localhost:3000 in the address bar to view the project.

## User Stories Employed to Determine Behavior Driven Development Strategy

* As user I want to be able to create an account as either a mentor or a mentee
* As a user I want the app to store limited data about me, email, phone, my name and the languages/technologies in which I'm working. 
* As a user I want to have the option to include more data as I see fit, a basic bio as well as information on my current professional position and my physical location so that I can find matches based on this data
* As a mentor I want to see a list of all potential mentees working with technologies that parallel my expertise.
* As a mentor I want the app to recommend best matches based on interest and location.
* As a mentee I want to be able to find potential mentors working with similar technology.

## Known Bugs

Site is unfinished. A user can create, read, edit and delete a personal account. Users may also create, read, update and delete a technology but site does not currently have functionality for making relationships between users and technologies or for finding user matches.
